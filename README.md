# Simple-Sonic-The-Hedgehog-Website-Pure-HTML-CSS-
A simple HTML/CSS website project, with Sonic The Hedgehog theming. If you want to use the code, feel free to do it.

This is just a simple HTML/CSS project, only for me to practice. I do not own: any of the graphic content (the majority are all taken from the Internet, but the ones edited by me have a .xfc file in this folder, wich you are totally free to use), the Sonic IP, and the text content is a copy from the site Power Sonic (http://www.powersonic.com.br), with slight changes. Thus, nothing here is targeted to profit. Regarding the code, you are totally free to use as you will, and no credits are needed.
